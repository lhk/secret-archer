initialization
--------------
After cloning the repository, just run init.sh / init.bat.

Note for windows users: To run init.bat, you need to have a `bash` in your path. `bash` is for example provided by `cygwin` or [msysgit](https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit).

If you want to work on the project, you should run devinit.sh / devinit.bat instead. Apart from the usual initialization, it installs brunch globally, which allows building the project.
Be sure to run devinit.sh as root.

dependencies
------------

* wget
* node.js
